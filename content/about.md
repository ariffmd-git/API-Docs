In the realms beyond work, I find solace in the art of Public Speaking, Image Consulting, and Philanthropy - living the moments that resonate with my inner self. Exploring nature’s wonders fuels my passion for travelling and embracing the serenity of the outdoors.

Music, a constant companion, adds rhythm to my life, inspiring moments of creativity and relaxation. Besides, I’m a consciousness hacker, a pet lover, a humanist, and a giver of all sorts. The one who champions the belief that every living being on Earth deserves an equal right to inhabit this planet according to their terms for as long as they exist here.
