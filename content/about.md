In the realms beyond work, I find solace in the art of Public Speaking, Image Consulting, and Philanthropy - living the moments that resonate with my inner self. Exploring nature’s wonders fuels my passion for travelling and embracing the serenity of the outdoors.

Music, a constant companion, adds rhythm to my life, inspiring moments of creativity and relaxation. Besides, I’m a consciousness hacker, a pet lover, a humanist, and a giver of all sorts. The one who champions the belief that every living being on Earth deserves an equal right to inhabit this planet according to their terms for as long as they exist here.

### My Professional Odyssey
* I make unfamiliar things look less frightening.
* I write menu names, button names, option labels, dialog box headings, error messages, notifications, and every little thing you see on user interfaces.
* I also write HowTos, tutorials, API references, admin and deployment guides, and other long-form text that you need to get a software up and running and using it.
* Sometimes, I make videos.
* At other times, I draw wireframes and prototypes for user interfaces.
* At all times, I remain curious. Because, that’s what helps me write for you — my reader — you who will use my words to get your task done as fast as possible.
