title: "Who Am I?"

In the realms beyond work, I find solace in the art of Public Speaking, Image Consulting, and Philanthropy - living the moments that resonate with my inner self. My love for cooking takes me on flavorful adventures, experimenting with diverse cuisines. Exploring nature's wonders fuels my passion for travelling, embracing the serenity of the outdoors. 

Music, a constant companion, adds rhythm to my life, inspiring moments of creativity and relaxation. Besides, I'm a consciousness hacker, a pet lover, a humanist, and a giver of all-sorts. Finally, the one who champions the belief that every living being on Earth deserves an equal right to inhabit this planet according to their own terms for as long as they exist here
