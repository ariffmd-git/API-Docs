<u>Great Developer Documentation** and API reference for your software products!!!</u>


Hello! I’m Arif,, a seasoned user assistance developer, writer, and editor. I specialize in writing for developer audiences —both experts and beginners. In the past, I worked at **Postman**, **Turvo**, **Oracle**, and **Paysafe** - writing API references and testing APIs using *Postman*. At Postman, I drove the entire API Platform documentation, providing documentation strategy and vision as a lone writer.

My work includes API reference documentation, API tutorials like **API QuickStart**, **API Getting Started** guides, **API Error Messages**, and so on. I also worked on **SDKs and Microcopy**. If interested, you can check out my portfolio page on this site. 

I’ve had the experience of testing API endpoints while writing API docs for companies since 2014. Most of my work has been with technology, mainly CRM, Supply Chain, FinTech, and Logistics companies eager to simplify their API adoption while offering a better developer experience.

### My Professional Endeavors
* I make unfamiliar things look less frightening.
* I write menu names, button names, option labels, dialog box headings, error messages, notifications, and every little thing you see on user interfaces.
* I also write HowTos, tutorials, API references, admin and deployment guides, and other long-form text that you need to get a software up and running and using it.
* Sometimes, I make videos.
* At other times, I draw wireframes and prototypes for user interfaces.
* At all times, I remain curious. Because, that’s what helps me write for you — my reader — you who will use my words to get your task done as fast as possible.
